A Private Journal

README
======

This is a simple VIM plugin that allows you to easy keep a daily, GPG-encrypted
journal. 

Please note that this is my first "real" VIM script. It's mostly an exercise to
help me learn more about the Vimscript language.

Also, please note that this is not even close to being done. I just wanted to
get it up on Github as soon as I could :)
